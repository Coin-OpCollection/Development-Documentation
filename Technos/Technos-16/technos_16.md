# **Technos 16-bit System**
## **Introduction**
This document is a technical overview of the Technos 16-bit system. It covers the high level architecture and subsystems of games Combatribes, Double Dragon 3 and WWF Wrestlefest. All 3 of these are slightly different boards from eachother, but the architecture is relatively the same.
