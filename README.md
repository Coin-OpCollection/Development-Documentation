# **Coin-Op Collection Archives**
This repository contains useful technical information about the base platform systems of FPGA cores we have released. We will continue to add more documentation, so please bookmark this site. Whenever possible, we will include schematics or scans from our own collection, reverse-engineered designs, or publicly available internet resources relevant to the platform's games.
